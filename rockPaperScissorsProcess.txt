OBJECTIVE:
This program will allow the user to play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.
-We will create code that checks who won each round
-We will create code takes input(choices) from the user
-We will create code that takes 'input'(choices) from the computer
-We will create code that checks if the user wants to quit, or if the user doesn't enter one of the options(rock, paper, or scissors)
-We will loop each round of the game
-We will add statements at the end and the beginning that welcome and thank the user for playing
-We will loop the whole game, so that the user can keep playing until they choose to quit 








PSEUDOCODE:

#set variable keepPlaying to true
#While keepPlaying is true:
    
    #print statment welcoming players to the game
    #print statement stating the rules(best 2 out of 3 press 'q' to quit)
    
    #make a key that assigns a number to each choice for the computer
    # (rock is 1, scissors is 2, paper is 3)
    
    #import the random function
    
    #set computer's score to 0
    #set player's score 0
    
    #while player's score is less than 2 and computer's score is less than 2:
        #computer's choice = random number between 1 and 3
        #player's choice = input(ask player to select Rock, Paper or Scissors)
        
        #if player inputs "q" or "Q":
        #   set keepPlaying to False
        #   stop the loop
            
        #else if (player inputs rock and computer chooses rock) or
        #(player inputs paper and computer chooses paper) or
        #(player inputs scissors and computer chooses scissors):
        #   print out DRAW
        #   print out player's score and computer's score
            
        #else if (player inputs rock and computer chooses scissors) or
